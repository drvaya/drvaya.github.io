# No Nerd Cloud Podcast : IBM and Aawaz.com

### The No Nerd Cloud Podcast is a first-of-its kind podcast for business owners and decision-makers who are looking for actionable insights around cloud technology. IBM and India's leading spoken-word audio and podcast network Aawaz.com jointly produced this podcast that will be low on jargon and geared towards the latest in IBM Cloud.

I was privileged to be the host of this season and get a stage with industry experts to understand and demystify some concepts around the Cloud landscape.
